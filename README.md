# Cart-Abandonment-Personal
# Cart Abandonment Analysis — README

## Project Overview

This project analyzes customer behavior related to cart abandonment, identifying key drivers and providing actionable insights to improve conversion rates.

## Required Sections

### 0. **Summary of Business Problem and Project Objective**

The business faces significant loss of potential revenue due to customers adding items to their carts but not completing their purchases. This project aims to identify the primary causes of cart abandonment and develop data‑driven recommendations to increase checkout conversion rates.

### 0.1 **Group's Solution to the Business Problem**

Our group built a comprehensive analytical pipeline that includes data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling. We identified the most influential behavioral and product‑related predictors of cart abandonment and proposed targeted interventions to improve conversion.

### 0.2 **My Contribution to the Project**

I contributed by assisting with feature engineering, building predictive models, interpreting model outputs, and contributing to the final recommendations. I also helped prepare visuals and summaries for stakeholder presentation.

### 0.3 **Business Value of the Solution**

The insights from this project support strategic decisions that can reduce abandonment by improving user experience. Even modest improvements in conversion can deliver significant revenue increases due to the high volume of users reaching the cart stage.

### 0.4 **Difficulties Encountered**

Our group encountered challenges related to incomplete session data, inconsistent product attributes, and aligning datasets across multiple sources. We also worked through model overfitting and determining which KPIs would be most actionable to stakeholders.

### 0.5 **What I Learned**

I learned how to build and evaluate predictive models for real‑world business problems, interpret behavioral drivers of customer decisions, and translate analytical findings into business recommendations that support measurable impact.

### 1. **Project Purpose**

The purpose of this project is to understand why customers abandon their carts and to quantify the impact of various factors—such as session behavior, product attributes, and user segments—on the likelihood of checkout completion.

### 2. **Data Sources**

* Web session logs
* Transaction data
* Product catalog metadata
* Customer attributes (anonymized)

  (Not Shared per Request of Company)

### 3. **Business Questions**

* What are the primary drivers of cart abandonment?
* Which product or session features are most predictive of purchase completion?
* How do user segments differ in checkout behavior?
* What is the estimated ROI of interventions targeting abandonment?

### 4. **Methods and Modeling**

* Data cleaning and feature engineering
* Exploratory data analysis
* Logistic regression and tree-based models to identify key predictors
* Uplift analysis for targeted interventions

### 5. **Key Findings**

* Longer session durations correlate with lower abandonment likelihood.
* Certain product categories have significantly higher abandonment rates.
* Return visitors convert at a much higher rate than first-time visitors.
* Shipping cost visibility significantly impacts drop-offs.

### 6. **Recommendations**

* Improve transparency around shipping costs.
* Implement targeted reminders for high-intent users.
* Streamline mobile checkout flow.
* Highlight trust signals (reviews, guarantees) on product pages.
